### MacMURRAY ESTATE VINEYARDS

#### 2016 Central Coast Pinot Noir

Ruby red in the glass, the MacMurray Estate Vineyards Central Coast Pinot Noir opens with juicy fruit aromas such as ripe cherry, currant and pomegranate, followed by distinct spice notes on the palate. Fine, plush tannins, red fruit notes and hints of vanilla make this the ideal wine to enjoy with a cheese and antipasto platter with friends on a breezy summer evening.
