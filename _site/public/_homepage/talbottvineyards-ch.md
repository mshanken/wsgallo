### TALBOTT VINEYARDS

#### 2016 Kali Hart Chardonnay, Sleepy Hollow Vineyard

Talbottâ€™s Sleepy Hollow Vineyard sits upon an expansive hillside, 13 miles from Monterey Bay. Gravelly loam soils create rich, concentrated flavors in the wine. Fruit-forward and expressive, this Chardonnay has aromas of vanilla and brioche that lead to dense fruit notes of Bosc pear, pineapple and melon, all backed by a soft, clean finish. Slip it into your picnic basket for an exciting summer excursion.
