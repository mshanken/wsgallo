### FREI BROTHERS SONOMA RESERVE

#### 2016 Russian River Valley Chardonnay

From the heart of Dry Creek Valley’s renowned cool-climate region comes a wine that embodies the very fabric of Sonoma County. It’s soft yet complex; savvy yet relaxed. This Chardonnay’s pure varietal character is thanks in large part to the cooling maritime influences of the Russian River Valley. It’s full of ripe fruit notes such as apple and pineapple, complemented by hints of vanilla, caramel and toasted oak. This Chardonnay’s luscious mouth-feel and long, silky finish make it the perfect pairing with sun-soaked afternoons on a blanket or at the beach.
