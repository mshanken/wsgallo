### TALBOTT VINEYARDS

#### 2016 Kali Hart Pinot Noir, Sleepy Hollow Vineyard

Approachable and bright, this wine opens with cranberry, plum and red currant, then melds into soft and silky tannins. This Pinot Noir is the perfect transitional treat from a sun-dappled day to a memorable summer night. The long, luscious finish makes for an elegant rendition of a California sunset. Enjoy this well-balanced wine at happy hour and make this your choice for the night.
